## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/article-summarizer.git

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd article-summarizer

### 3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run frontmodel.py

### Usage
- After running the app, you will be presented with an input box on the homepage.
- Paste the article or text you wish to summarize in the input box.
- Click the Summarize button to generate the summarized text.
- The summary will be displayed on the screen.

### TextRank Algorithm
- This app uses the TextRank algorithm for summarizing text. TextRank is an unsupervised algorithm inspired by Google's PageRank. It extracts key sentences based on their importance in the text and ranks them to generate a concise summary.

### Future Improvements
- Improve text summarization accuracy by integrating additional algorithms.
- Enhance UI/UX for a better user experience.
- Add support for multi-language summarization.
